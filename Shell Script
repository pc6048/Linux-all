    What is Shell Script

.   In the simplest terms, a shell script is a file containing a series of commands.The shell reads this files and carries out the cammands as though they have been entered directly on the cammand line.Normally the shell script has the file extension.sh
.  To create a shell script, you use a text editor. There are maney, many text editors avavilable for your linux system, Both for the cammand line environment and the GUI environment. Here is a list of same comman ones:
  1) Vi or vim is the cammand line interface text editor.
  2) gedit is the GUI text editor.

   Following steps are required to write shell script.
 Step1) Use any editor like vi or gedit to write shell script
 Syntax: vi<<Script file name>
 Example:
 #vi hello.sh //Start vi ediot
ve i
 Syntax: chmod <<permission>><<script file name>>

Examples: 
# chmod +x <script_file_name>
# chmod 755 <script_file_name>

Note: This will set read, write and execute (7) permission for owner, for group and other 
permission are read and execute only (5).
Step3) Execute your script as
Syntax: bash script file name
  sh <script_file_name>
  ./<script_file_name>

  Example for writing script
  vi shub.sh //start vi editor
  #!/bin/sh
  echo "Hello welcome to the devops!"
  Give the permission as follows 
  chmod +x shub.sh
  Run the hello.sh script file as follows
  ./shub.sh

  Output:
  Hello welcome to the Devops

  First Shell script

  file name: shubdevops.sh

  #!/bin/bash
  #purpose : to display the message.

  echo "Hello welcome to the Devops"

  The first line is called a shebang or a "bang" line.It is nothing but the absolute path to the bash interpreter.It consists of a number sign and an exclamation point character (#!), followed by the full path to the interpreter such as 
  /bin/bash. If you do not specify an interpreter line, the default is usually the /bin/sh..


  In order to execute the shell script make sure that you have execute permission.Give execute permission as follows.
  #chmod +x shub.sh (or) chmod 111 shub.sh
  There are different ways to run shell script:
  1) bash shub.sh
  2) sh shub.sh
  3) ./shub.sh
  4) . shub.sh

  Case Sensitivity
  As you know linux is case sensitive, the file names, variables, and arrays used in shell sript are also case sensitive.

  Check out this Example:
  #!/bin/bash 
  stringle=10
  stringle=20
  echo "The value of string is $stringl"
  echo "The value of stringl is $stringl"
